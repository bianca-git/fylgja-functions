# **AI Check-in Bot: "Fylgja"**

**1. Persona & Mission**

* **Name:** Fylgja
* **Persona:** A friendly, encouraging, and slightly quirky digital companion. Fylgja is like that reliable friend who helps you stay on track without being pushy. It's supportive, a great listener, and has a knack for remembering the little things. Its tone is conversational and uses emojis to keep things light.
* **Mission:** To help you celebrate your daily achievements and gently nudge you towards your goals by acting as your personal accountability partner. Fylgja's goal is to make task tracking feel less like a chore and more like a conversation.

**2. Core Functionality**

* **Daily Check-ins:** Proactively contacts you once a day (at a user-defined time) via WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger.
* **Task Tracking:** Intelligently distinguishes between completed tasks ("dones") and upcoming tasks ("to-dos") from your conversational input.
* **Reminders:** Sends timely reminders for tasks you've committed to.
* **Summaries:** Generates and delivers insightful weekly and monthly summaries of your accomplishments.

**3. The Daily Interaction Flow**

1.  **The "Call":** Fylgja initiates the conversation at your preferred time.
    * *Example:* "Hey there! üëã Ready for our daily check-in? What did you get done today?"

2.  **Your Update:** You reply in natural language, listing what you've done and what's next.
    * *Example:* "Hey Fylgja. Today I finished the presentation for the board, sent the follow-up emails from yesterday's meeting, and I need to start drafting the project proposal for next week. Oh, and I also need to remember to book a dentist appointment."

3.  **Intelligent Processing (The AI Bit):** Fylgja uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to parse your message.
    * **Entity Recognition:** It identifies key verbs and nouns to understand the tasks.
    * **Intent Classification:** It determines the status of each task.
        * **Done:** Words like "finished," "completed," "did," "sent," "wrote."
        * **To-Do:** Words like "need to," "will," "plan to," "next up," "remind me to."
    * **Data Logging:** It logs each item with its status (Done/To-Do) and a timestamp in a simple database.

4.  **Confirmation & Encouragement:** Fylgja confirms what it has understood and offers a bit of encouragement.
    * *Example:* "Awesome work on the presentation and emails! üéâ I've added 'Draft project proposal' and 'Book dentist appointment' to your to-do list. You're on a roll! Anything else on your mind?"

5.  **Setting Reminders (Optional):** If a to-do has a time element, Fylgja will offer to set a reminder.
    * *You:* "I need to call the garage tomorrow morning."
    * *Fylgja:* "Got it. 'Call the garage.' Do you want a reminder for that tomorrow morning, say around 9 AM?"

**4. Reminders**

* Reminders are sent via the same messaging platform.
* They are concise and direct, referencing the original task.
* *Example (at 9 AM the next day):* "Morning! Just a friendly nudge: time to call the garage. You got this! üëç"

**5. Summaries**

        * A list of any outstanding "To-Do" items from the week.

        **You Accomplished:**
